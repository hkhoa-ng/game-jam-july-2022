A game made during 5 days for the [Jame Gam](https://itch.io/jam/jame-gam-20) game jam on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) with my friend, [Huy](https://github.com/NhoxxKienn).

The theme of the jam was **Two Worlds**, and the additional special feature was **The Cake**. We decided to make a top-down shooter game, with the protagonist having to traverse between rooms in two different worlds. The room themes are **vegetable** and **food**. Finally, we made a **cake boss** at the end of the game. The player has to beat the boss in order to win the game!

We made the game using the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine and C#. I took care of all the art assets for the game using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). We then write scripts for the game, and also playtest it ourselves.

We implemented a simple procedural generation algorithm similar to the one that got introduced in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUskxXXTh7s&t=16s). That way, every time the player plays the game, they will get a slightly different experience. 

We ended up #4th place overall in the jam. Needless to say, I am very happy because this is the first game jam I ever participated in, and we learned alot during the process! You can try the game at our [Itch.io page](https://nhoxkien.itch.io/karik).
